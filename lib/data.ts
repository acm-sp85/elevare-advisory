      challenge: "In many organisations, complex or non-standard deals are handled individually. There’s no defined process, approval paths are unclear and key teams like finance or legal are brought in too late. Every exception creates more back-and-forth and deals stall waiting for decisions. \n\nThe result: longer deal cycles, inconsistent outcomes, margin leakage, higher risk, frustrated teams, and executives approving deals they wouldn't have pursued in the first place.",

      challenge:
    "Signing a deal does not automatically mean it is ready to be executed. In complex agreements, unresolved assumptions, differing interpretations, or missing ownership often surface only after signature.

      challenge: "Winning the right deals requires more than a good idea or a strong proposal. It requires clear choices, disciplined preparation, and consistent execution across capture and bid activities.

    "Many organisations invest heavily in tools and platforms, yet still struggle with how work actually gets done.
