      title: "Deal process management",
      subtitle: "Deal process & deal desk",
      description: "When managing large or complex deals is a painful process, decisions take longer than needed or responsibilities are unclear, we take lead in setting up a clear deal process or designated deal desk. This ensures deals move efficiently through approvals, exceptions, pricing, and governance so opportunities don’t stall.",
      slug: "deal-process-management",
        challenge:
    "In many organisations, deals slow down not because of market conditions, but because internal processes cannot keep up. Pricing exceptions, approvals, risk reviews, and governance steps become bottlenecks—especially in complex or high-value opportunities. The result is delayed decisions, inconsistent outcomes, and unnecessary leadership involvement.",
  whatIDo: [
    "Design or improve deal and approval processes",
    "Set up or optimise deal desks",
    "Clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision rights",
    "Define pricing, risk, and exception workflows",
    "Support complex or sensitive deals through internal governance",
    "Reduce friction between sales, finance, legal, and leadership"
  ],
  typicalSituations: [
    "Deals stall in approval loops",
    "Pricing and margin decisions are inconsistent",
    "Responsibility for approvals is unclear",
    "Senior leadership is pulled into routine deal decisions",
    "Deal governance differs per team or region"
  ],
  outcome:
    "Faster deal turnaround, clear accountability, better margin control, reduced leadership involvement—and a deal process people actually use.",

      description: "When signed deals come under pressure across scope, responsibility, and commercial terms, we ensure post-signature agreements are executable, stakeholders are aligned, and escalation is managed efficiently.",
      slug: "deal-transition-alignment",
        challenge:
    "Signing a deal does not automatically mean it is ready to be executed. In complex agreements, unresolved assumptions, differing interpretations, or missing ownership often surface only after signature. Without intervention, this leads to escalation, renegotiation, delivery friction, and early margin erosion.",
  whatIDo: [
    "Review the signed agreement, pricing, and assumptions",
    "Identify execution risks and pressure points",
    "Align sales, delivery, legal, and finance",
    "Clarify scope interpretation and responsibilities",
    "Define governance and escalation paths",
    "Support structured post-signature discussions when needed",

    "Delivery challenges what was sold",
    "Scope and expectations differ across teams",
    "Pricing or margin comes under pressure during planning",
    "Leadership is drawn into repeated escalations",
    "Post-signature discussions drift without structure",
    "Multi-stakeholder deals lose momentum after signing"
  ],
  outcome:
    "Fewer escalations, clear ownership and decision rights, a protected commercial position, and a faster, calmer start of delivery.",

      slug: "capture-bid-support",
       challenge:
    "Winning the right deals requires more than a good idea or a strong proposal. It requires clear choices, disciplined preparation, and consistent execution across capture and bid activities. Without structure and ownership, teams lose focus, messages fragment, deadlines slip, and senior stakeholders are pulled in too late.",
  whatIDo: [
    "Support opportunity qualification and bid/no-bid decisions",
    "Help shape win strategy and positioning",
    "Manage end-to-end bid and RFP processes",
    "Structure timelines, responsibilities, and governance",

    "Bids run late or lack ownership",
    "Messages are inconsistent across sections",
    "Senior stakeholders are insufficiently prepared for pitches",
    "Internal teams struggle to work together under deadline pressure"
  ],
  outcome:
    "Better focus on the right opportunities, stronger and more coherent proposals, more controlled bid processes, and improved confidence in client-facing moments.",

      slug: "processes-roles-collaboration",
       challenge:
    "Many organisations invest heavily in tools and platforms, yet still struggle with how work actually gets done. The issue is rarely the technology itself, but unclear processes, roles, and decision-making frameworks. Without alignment, adoption remains low, collaboration breaks down, and the expected value of transformation initiatives is never realised.",
  whatIDo: [
    "Assess current ways of working across teams",
    "Clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision points",
    "Support implementation of digital workplace tools",
    "Translate business needs into practical operating models",
